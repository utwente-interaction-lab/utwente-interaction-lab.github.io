		<h1>Transition to new reservation system</h1>
		We are transitioning to a new reservation system for our lab equipment. With the new system it should be much easier for you to view when equipment is available and to manage your reservation. We use the "Booqable" platform, which offers a webshop-style user interface for browsing and searching equipment.
		
		<p>
		<strong>Existing reservations</strong> are still tracked manually through our regular <a href="mailto:interaction-lab-eemcs@utwente.nl">e-mail address</a>. We may decide to transition long-standing existing reservation to the new system, you will get an (automated) message in that case. 
		</p>
		<p>
		<strong>All new reservations</strong> should be done through the new system:
		<ol>
		<li>Go to the <a href="https://utwente-interaction-lab.booqable.shop/">new booking system</a></li>
		<li>Select a preferred pickup and return date to specify the duration of your reservation</li>
		<li>Search available equipment or browse through categories</li>
		<li>Click on a product image or title to view details. From there, you can easily check availability on specific dates</li>
		<li>Press the button "Add to reservation" to add the item</li>
		<li>Continue browsing and adding equipment as needed</li>
		<li>Open the "Shopping cart" in the top right corner to continue to checkout</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>Completing your reservation request:</strong>
		<ol>
		<li>You may create an account or continue as Guest</li>
		<li>Fill the required details (please use your @utwente email address)</li>
		<li>Please use the remarks field if you have questions or remarks about this reservation (e.g. if you want a specific piece of equipment 'HMI-xyz')</li>
		<li>We will review your request (we aim to do this within one working day)</li>
		<li>Depending on our presence in the lab we will negotiate a specific pickup and return time</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>What if the equipment is not on the list?</h2>
		We are working hard on updating the inventory, but not all equipment is listed there yet! Send us an <a href="mailto:interaction-lab-eemcs@utwente.nl">e-mail</a> and we will ensure that the specific equipment becomes available for your reservation. <a href="#inventory">Scroll down on this page</a> for a full overview of available equipment. 
		
		<p>
		Still can't find what you need? Perhaps the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/designlab/organisation/Facilities/#upstairs">DesignLab</a>, <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/smartxp/ItemLibrary/#electronic-devices">SmartXP</a>, or <a href="https://bmslab.utwente.nl/info-hub/knowledgebase/">BMSLab</a> has the equipment that you are looking for. If not, contact your supervisor and <a href="mailto:d.p.davison@utwente.nl">Daniel Davison</a> to discuss other options.
		</p>
		
		<h2>How long can I reserve equipment?</h2>
		Since we are sharing this equipment with each other, please donâ€™t reserve it longer than you need. We aim for a maximum of 1~2 weeks at a time. Depending on your circumstances you may need more, discuss this with your supervisor and with Daniel.
		
		<h2>Feedback</h2>
		<a href="mailto:interaction-lab-eemcs@utwente.nl">Please let us know</a> any feedback, remarks, suggestions or if you encounter problems with the new system
