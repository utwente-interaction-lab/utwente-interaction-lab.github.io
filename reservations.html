		<h1>Interaction Lab reservation system</h1>
		We have recently transitioned to a new reservation system for our lab equipment. With the new system you can easily view when certain equipment is available and can make your own reservation directly. We use the "Booqable" platform, which offers a webshop-style user interface for browsing and searching equipment.
		
		<p>
		<strong>All new reservations</strong> should be done through the new system:
		
		<div><a href="https://utwente-interaction-lab.booqable.shop/" id="reservation-button">Go to the new booking system</a></div>
		
		<ol>
		<li>Select a preferred pickup and return date to specify the duration of your reservation</li>
		<li>Search available equipment or browse through categories</li>
		<li>Click on a product image or title to view details. From there, you can easily check availability on specific dates</li>
		<li>Press the button "Add to reservation" to add the item</li>
		<li>Continue browsing and adding equipment as needed</li>
		<li>Open the "Shopping cart" in the top right corner to continue to checkout</li>
		</ol>
		</p>
		
		<p>
		<strong>Completing your reservation request:</strong>
		<ol>
		<li>You may create an account or continue as Guest</li>
		<li>Fill the required details (please use your @utwente email address)</li>
		<li>Please use the remarks field if you have questions or remarks about this reservation (e.g. if you want a specific piece of equipment 'HMI-xyz')</li>
		<li>We will review your request (we aim to do this within one working day)</li>
		<li>Depending on our presence in the lab we will negotiate a specific pickup and return time</li>
		</ol>
		</p>

		<h2>What if the equipment is not on the list?</h2>
		The reservation system contains our most used equipment. Send us an <a href="mailto:interaction-lab-eemcs@utwente.nl">e-mail</a> if you have trouble finding something.
		
		<p>
		Perhaps the <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/designlab/organisation/Facilities/#upstairs">DesignLab</a>, <a href="https://www.utwente.nl/en/eemcs/smartxp/ItemLibrary/#electronic-devices">SmartXP</a>, or <a href="https://bmslab.utwente.nl/info-hub/knowledgebase/">BMSLab</a> has the equipment that you are looking for. If not, contact your supervisor and <a href="mailto:d.p.davison@utwente.nl">Daniel Davison</a> to discuss other options.
		</p>
		
		<h2>How long can I reserve equipment?</h2>
		Since we are sharing this equipment with each other, please donâ€™t reserve it longer than you need. We aim for a maximum of 1~2 weeks at a time, but are flexible in this. Depending on your circumstances you may need more, discuss this with your supervisor and with Daniel.
		
		<h2>Feedback</h2>
		<a href="mailto:interaction-lab-eemcs@utwente.nl">Please let us know</a> any feedback, remarks, suggestions or if you encounter problems with the new system
